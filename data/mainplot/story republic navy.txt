			`	"I sure hope you've come ready to work, captain," he says. "The tensions in the South may have just turned into a full blown war, and there has been a priority request for some medical equipment that has been ignored by every other base and warehouse. Looks like they're going to need some of ours."`

Anyway look, its ten units, one ton a piece. Very light weight, you wont even notice it in your cargo hold. Just get it to New Tibet as quick as you can." He points you at your ship, where you can clearly see dock workers already loading crates.`

			`	Without you getting a chance to say anything, he recites a lecture that the Navy often gives to people studying for their pilots licenses.`
			`	"It's pretty rare," he begins, "but sometimes survivors of ship decompression suffer from altitude sickness or the bends. People from high gravity world get the worst of it. So we use high flow oxygen tanks and pressure suits to help them recover." He ends the lecture here, saying "Now, I got a thousand other crisis on my plate. Get going, Captain."`
