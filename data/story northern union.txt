			`If pirate worlds had a "nice side of town," the Rusted Wheel Cafe would be located in it. You enter this cute shop, and immediately hear a familiar voice. "Captain <last>, I knew you would join us."`

				`	(Join him and place an order)`
				`	(Leave.)`
					decline
			`	"Good decision, joining me. My boss will be over any minute now." Some time passes before eventually an incredibly tall, noseless man joins you. He looks almost exactly like the descriptions of the Augments known as Alphas from centuries ago.`
			`	"Boss, I have brought you tribute!" Peg shouts, as you feel a hard, cold object press against the side of your skull. Before you even get a chance to react, you feel a warm splattering on your cheek. You look over to see Peg, dying, with some sort of metal spike sticking out of his forehead.`
			`	"I would appologize for the mess," the towering beast drones, "Considering I just saved your life from my incompetent underling, I'll assume you have already forgiven me." He gives off a strange huffing sound that almost seems like a chuckle, "Please, stay. I sense you aren't as useless as this deflating mess next to you."`

				decline

			`	"Not human," the creature makes that strange chuckling sound again, "I'm a genetically modified life form, similar to human augments, but not quite. I am specifically of the species known as Alphas."`
			`"Do you have any other questions? Before you say it, yes I am an Alpha, and I promised myself the next person to say 'Wait you're an Alpha` would die slowly by my hand."

			`	The Alpha casually grabs Peg out of his seat, throws him across the cafe, and sits in the warlord's now vacant seat. "Oh, where do I begin? Let's start with our genesis."`
			`	"I'm sure you know already that we were created as super soldiers to be used by various factions, but the reason for that is because those in charge were getting reports of normal soldiers refusing orders.  Things such as leveling towns full of innocent bystanders, shooting down unarmed passenger ships, contaminating spaceports with radiation or bioweapons, that sort of thing. The human soldiers were apparently brought up with the idea that 'life was sacred' or something." His tone turns to what you can only assume is mockery, "And that 'only bad people' should be killed, and when faced with the flimsy excuses for why they were slaughtering these innocents, they tended to refuse like the cowards they were."`
			`	The being calls over a waiter, and whispers his order, before continuing. There is an interesting smell in the air, which both turns your stomach and compels you to be silent.`
			`	"So, where was I?" He pauses, "Ah yes, our origins. It was decided that there was a need for soldiers who were "emotionless," and well cheaper to maintain for increased combat efficiency.  Starting with your "basic" human, it was decided to focus on developing a streamlined combat being, one which would obey orders without question, and could be fielded without much overhead. Turns out your human frame is about the only useful thing about you in combat, however. The limits of genetic engineering at the time, however, seemed to be infinite. So they started taking samples from various bugs. Cockroaches, bacteria strains, grasshoppers. They set out to create the perfect beings, us. A perfect blend of strenght, agility, tactical prowess, radiation and bioweapon resistances, and natural built in and regenerating armor in the form of our exoskeleton. Capable of surviving and fighting for hours in empty space, or under water, or in most any environment, really. Only occasionally with extra gear."`
			choice
				`	(Attempt to resist the smell and speak freely.)`
				`	(Continue sitting in silence.)`
			`	The scent is overpowering, you can't resist it. After making the initial choice to listen, he apparently wanted to make sure his story wasn't interrupted.`
			`	"Ah, but I have gone on for too long. for this one conversation, and I can tell you would like to move on."`
			choice
				`	(Run for your life!)`
					decline
				`	"Are you all so tall?"`
					goto tall
				`	"Yes, lets move on. I heard you were offering work?"
					goto work
			label tall
			`	He makes that chuckling sound again, "No, in fact some of my kind are even shorter than you. I was created specifically for interrogation and command. Unlike my smaller brethren, intended mostly for combat. Now, let's talk about that job."`
